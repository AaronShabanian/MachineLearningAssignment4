       "'THE QUEEN _of_ HEARTS       The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts,       All on a summer\\'s day;      The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts,       And took them clean away.      The King of Hearts called for those tarts,     And beat the Knave full sore.      The Knave of Hearts brought back those tarts,       And vowed he\\'d steal no more.     SAINT SWITHIN\\'S DAY       St. Swithin\\'s day, if thou dost rain,     For forty days it will remain;     St. Swithin\\'s day, if thou be fair,     For forty days \\'t will rain no more.

Dance to your daddie,       My bonnie laddie,     Dance to your daddie, and to your mammie sing!       You shall get a coatie,       And a pair of breekies,     You shall get a coatie when the boat comes in!     THE MAN IN THE MOON       The man in the moon     Came tumbling down     And asked the way to Norwich;     He went by the south,     And burnt his mouth     With eating cold pease porridge.     SIMPLE SIMON       Simple Simon met a pie-man,       Going to the fair;     Says Simple Simon to the pie-man,       \"Let me taste your ware.\"      Says the pie-man unto Simon,       \"First give me a penny.\"     Says Simple Simon to the pie-man,       \"I have not got any.\"      He went to catch a dicky-bird,       And thought he could not fail,     Because he had got a little salt       To put upon his tail.      He went to ride a spotted cow,       That had got a little calf,     She threw him down upon the ground,       Which made the people laugh.      Then Simple Simon went a-hunting,       For to catch a hare,     He rode a goat about the street,       But could not find one there.      He went for to eat honey       Out of the mustard-pot,     He bit his tongue until he cried,       That was all the good he got.      Simple Simon went a-fishing       For to catch a whale;     And all the water he had got       Was in his mother\\'s pail.      He went to take a bird\\'s nest,       Was built upon a bough;     A branch gave way, and Simon fell       Into a dirty slough.      He went to shoot a wild duck,       But the wild duck flew away;     Says Simon, \"I can\\'t hit him,       Because he will not stay.\"      Once Simon made a great Snowball,       And brought it in to roast;     He laid it down before the fire,       And soon the ball was lost.      He went to slide upon the ice,       Before the ice would bear;     Then he plunged in above his knees,       Which made poor Simon stare.      He went to try if cherries ripe       Grew upon a thistle;     He pricked his finger very much,       Which made poor Simon whistle.      He washed himself with blacking-ball,       Because he had no soap:     Then, then, said to his mother,       \"I\\'m a beauty now, I hope.\"      He went for water in a sieve,       But soon it all ran through;     And now poor Simple Simon       Bids you all adieu.     TOAD AND FROG       \"Croak,\" said the toad, \"I\\'m hungry I think,     To-day I\\'ve had nothing to eat or to drink;     I\\'ll crawl to a garden and jump through the pales,     And there I\\'ll dine nicely on slugs and on snails.\"      \"Ho, ho!\" quoth the frog, \"is that what you mean?     Then I\\'ll hop away to the next meadow stream,     There I will drink, and eat worms and slugs too,     And then I shall have a good dinner like you.\"     LITTLE JACK HORNER         Little Jack Horner       Sat in a corner     Eating of Christmas pie;        He put in his thumb,       And pulled out a plum,     And cried \"What a good boy was I!\"     THE WOOING           There was a little man,         Who wooed a little maid;     And he said: \"Little maid, will you wed, wed, wed?         I have little more to say,         So will you ay or nay     For the least said is soonest mend-ed, ded, ded.\"          Then the little maid replied:         \"Should I be your little bride,     Pray what must we have for to eat, eat, eat?         Will the flame that you\\'re so rich in         Light a fire in the kitchen?     Or the little god of Love turn the spit, spit, spit?\"     HANDY PANDY       Handy Pandy, Jack-a-Dandy,       Loves plum-cake and sugar-candy;     He bought some at a grocer\\'s shop,       And out he came, hop, hop, hop.     THE KILKENNY CATS       There were once two cats of Kilkenny,     Each thought there was one cat too many;     So they fought and they fit,     And they scratched and they bit,     Till, excepting their nails     And the tips of their tails,     Instead of two cats, there weren\\'t any.     BLOW WIND BLOW       Blow, wind, blow! and go, mill, go!       That the miller may grind his corn;     That the baker may take it, and into rolls make it,       And send us some hot in the morn.     ONE, TWO, THREE, AND FOUR LEGS       Two legs sat upon three legs,     With one leg in his lap;     In comes four legs,     And runs away with one leg.      Up jumps two legs,     Catches up three legs,     Throws it after four legs,     And makes him bring back one leg.     BLUE BELL BOY       I had a little boy,       And called him Blue Bell;     Gave him a little work,       He did it very well.      I bade him go upstairs       To bring me a gold pin;     In coal-scuttle fell he,       Up to his little chin.      He went to the garden       To pick a little sage;     He tumbled on his nose,       And fell into a rage.      He went to the cellar       To draw a little beer;     And quickly did return       To say there was none there.     COCK-A-DOODLE-DO       Cock-a-doodle-do!     My dame has lost her shoe;     My master\\'s lost his fiddle-stick,     And don\\'t know what to do.      Cock-a-doodle-do!     What is my dame to do?     Till master finds his fiddle-stick,     She\\'ll dance without her shoe.     JOHN COOK\\'S GREY MARE       John Cook had a little grey mare; he, haw, hum!     Her back stood up, and her bones they were bare; he, haw, hum!      John Cook was riding up Shuter\\'s bank; he, haw, hum!     And there his nag did kick and prank; he, haw, hum!      John Cook was riding up Shuter\\'s hill; he, haw, hum!     His mare fell down, and she made her will; he, haw, hum!      The bridle and saddle were laid on the shelf; he, haw, hum!     If you want any more you may sing it yourself; he, haw, hum!     BUZ AND HUM       Buz, quoth the blue fly,       Hum, quoth the bee,     Buz and hum they cry,       And so do we.      In his ear, in his nose,       Thus, do you see?     He ate the dormouse,       Else it was he.     TOMMY TITTLEMOUSE       Little Tommy Tittlemouse     Lived in a little house;     He caught fishes     In other men\\'s ditches.     A AND B AND SEE       Great A, little a, bouncing B,     The cat\\'s in the cupboard and she can\\'t see.     DOCTOR FOSTER       Doctor Foster went to Glo\\'ster,     In a shower of rain;     He stepped in a puddle right up to his middle,     And never went there again.     DAFFY DOWN DILLY       Daffy-down-dilly has come to town,     In a yellow petticoat, and a green gown.     QUEEN ANNE       Queen Anne, Queen Anne, you sit in the sun,     As fair as a lily, as white as a wand.     I send you three letters, and pray read one,     You must read one, if you can\\'t read all     So pray Miss or Master throw up the ball.     HO MY KITTEN       Ho my kitten, a kitten,       And ho! my kitten, my deary!     Such a sweet pet as this       Was neither far nor neary.      Here we go up, up, up,       Here we go down, down, down;     Here we go backwards and forwards,       And here we go round, round, round.     LAVENDER BLUE       Lavender blue and rosemary green,     When I am king you shall be queen;     Call up my maids at four o\\'clock,     Some to the wheel and some to the rock,     Some to make hay and some to shear corn,     And you and I will keep ourselves warm.     THE QUARRELSOME KITTENS       Two little kittens one stormy night,     They began to quarrel and they began to fight;     One had a mouse and the other had none,     And that\\'s the way the quarrel begun.      \"I\\'ll have that mouse,\" said the biggest cat.     \"You\\'ll have that mouse? we\\'ll see about that!\"     \"I will have that mouse,\" said the eldest son.     \"You sha\\'n\\'t have the mouse,\" said the little one.      I told you before \\'t was a stormy night     When these two little kittens began to fight;     The old woman seized her sweeping broom,     And swept the two kittens right out of the room.      The ground was covered with frost and snow,     And the two little kittens had nowhere to go;     So they laid them down on the mat at the door,     While the old woman finished sweeping the floor.      Then they crept in, as quiet as mice,     All wet with the snow, and as cold as ice,     For they found it was better, that stormy night,     To lie down and sleep than to quarrel and fight.     THE FLY AND THE HUMBLE-BEE       Fiddle-de-dee, fiddle-de-dee,     The fly shall marry the humble-bee;      They went to church and married was she,     The fly has married the humble-bee.     CAT AND DOG       Pussy sits beside the fire,       How can she be fair?     In comes the little dog,       \"Pussy, are you there?      So, so, Mistress Pussy,       Pray, how do you do?\"      \"Thank you, thank you, little dog,       I\\'m very well just now.\"     BOBBY SHAFT       Bobby Shaft is gone to sea,     With silver buckles at his knee;     When he\\'ll come home he\\'ll marry me,     Pretty Bobby Shaft!      Bobby Shaft is fat and fair,     Combing down his yellow hair;     He\\'s my love for evermore!     Pretty Bobby Shaft!     THE LITTLE CLOCK       There\\'s a neat little clock,       In the schoolroom it stands,     And it points to the time       With its two little hands.     And may we, like the clock,       Keep a face clean and bright,     With hands ever ready      To do what is right.     LITTLE MAID       \"Little maid, pretty maid, whither goest thou?\"     \"Down in the forest to milk my cow.\"     \"Shall I go with thee?\" \"No, not now;     When I send for thee, then come thou.\"     BAT, BAT         Bat, bat,       Come under my hat,     And I\\'ll give you a slice of bacon;        And when I bake,       I\\'ll give you a cake,     If I am not mistaken.     CHRISTMAS       Christmas is coming, the geese are getting fat,     Please to put a penny in an old man\\'s hat;     If you haven\\'t got a penny, a ha\\'penny will do,     If you haven\\'t got a ha\\'penny, God bless you.     PETER WHITE       Peter White will ne\\'er go right,       And would you know the reason why?     He follows his nose where\\'er he goes,       And that stands all awry.     SLEEP BABY SLEEP         Sleep, baby, sleep,     Our cottage vale is deep;     The little lamb is on the green,     With woolly fleece so soft and clean--       Sleep, baby, sleep!        Sleep, baby, sleep,     Down where the woodbines creep;     Be always like the lamb so mild,     A kind, and sweet, and gentle child--       Sleep, baby, sleep!     UP PIPPEN HILL       As I was going up Pippen Hill,       Pippen Hill was dirty;     There I met a pretty miss,       And she dropped me a curtsey.      Little miss, pretty miss,       Blessings light upon you!     If I had half a crown a day,       I\\'d spend it all upon you.     A FALLING OUT       A little old man and I fell out;     How shall we bring this matter about?     Bring it about as well as you can;     Get you gone, you little old man.     TOM, THE PIPER\\'S SON       Tom, Tom, the piper\\'s son,     Stole a pig and away he run!     The pig was eat and Tom was beat,     And Tom went howling down the street.     PEG       Peg, Peg, with a wooden leg,       Her father was a miller;     He tossed the dumpling at her head,       And said he could not kill her.     A DIFFICULT RHYME       What is the rhyme for porringer?     The king he had a daughter fair,     And gave the Prince of Orange her.     THE OLD WOMAN TOSSED IN A BASKET       There was an old woman tossed up in a basket     Seventeen times as high as the moon;     Where she was going I couldn\\'t but ask it,     For in her hand she carried a broom.      \"Old woman, old woman, old woman,\" quoth I,     \"Where are you going to up so high?\"     \"To brush the cobwebs off the sky!\"     \"May I go with thee?\" \"Aye, by-and-by.\"     POOR OLD ROBINSON CRUSOE       Poor old Robinson Crusoe!     Poor old Robinson Crusoe!     They made him a coat     Of an old nanny goat,       I wonder why they could do so!     With a ring a ting tang,     And a ring a ting tang,     Poor old Robinson Crusoe!     TWO LITTLE DOGS       Two little dogs sat by the fire,       Over a fender of coal-dust;     When one said to the other dog,       \"If Pompey won\\'t talk, why, I must.\"     SATURDAY, SUNDAY       On Saturday night         Shall be all my care      To powder my locks         And curl my hair.      On Sunday morning         My love will come in,      When he will marry me         With a gold ring.     MERCHANTS _of_ LONDON       Hey diddle dinkety, poppety, pet.      The merchants of London they wear scarlet;     Silk in the collar, and gold in hem,     So merrily march the merchantmen.     THE OWL IN THE OAK       There was an owl lived in an oak,       Whiskey, whaskey, weedle;     And all the words he ever spoke       Were fiddle, faddle, feedle.      A sportsman chanced to come that way,       Whiskey, whaskey, weedle;     Says he, \"I\\'ll shoot you, silly bird,       So fiddle, faddle, feedle!\"     GEORGY PORGY       Georgy Porgy, pudding and pie,     Kissed the girls and made them cry.     When the boys came out to play,     Georgy Porgy ran away.     TO MARKET       To market, to market,       To buy a fat pig;     Home again, home again,       Jiggety jig.      To market, to market,       To buy a fat hog;     Home again, home again,       Jiggety jog.     THE LITTLE GUINEA-PIG       There was a little Guinea-Pig,     Who, being little, was not big;     He always walked upon his feet,     And never fasted when he eat.      When from a place he ran away,     He never at that place did stay;     And while he ran, as I am told,     He ne\\'er stood still for young or old.      He often squeak\\'d and sometimes vi\\'lent,     And when he squeak\\'d he ne\\'er was silent:     Though ne\\'er instructed by a cat,     He knew a mouse was not a rat.      One day, as I am certified,     He took a whim, and fairly died;     And, as I\\'m told by men of sense,     He never has been living since.     A NICK AND A NOCK       A nick and a nock,     A hen and a cock,     And a penny for my master.     PANCAKE DAY       Great A, little A,     This is pancake day;     Toss the ball high,     Throw the ball low,     Those that come after     May sing heigh-ho!     HUSH-A-BYE BABY       Hush-a-bye, baby,       On the tree top,     When the wind blows,       The cradle will rock;      When the bough breaks,       The cradle will fall,     Down tumbles baby,       Cradle, and all.     IN MARBLE HALLS       In marble halls as white as milk,     Lined with a skin as soft as silk;      Within a fountain crystal clear,     A golden apple doth appear;      No doors there are to this stronghold,     Yet thieves break in and steal the gold.     JACK SPRAT\\'S PIG       Jack Sprat had a pig, who was not very little,       Nor yet very big;     He was not very lean, he was not very fat;       He\\'ll do well for a grunt,     Says little Jack Sprat.     ROBIN-A-BOBIN       Robin-a-Bobin       Bent his bow,     Shot at a pigeon,       And killed a crow.     BANDY-LEGS       As I was going to sell my eggs,     I met a man with bandy legs;     Bandy legs and crooked toes,     I tripped up his heels, and he fell on his nose.

HUSH-A-BYE, BABY       Hush-a-bye, baby,       Daddy is near;     Mamma is a lady,       And that\\'s very clear.     BIRDS OF A FEATHER       Birds of a feather flock together,         And so will pigs and swine;     Rats and mice will have their choice,         And so will I have mine.     COCK-A-DOODLE-DO       Oh, my pretty cock! Oh, my handsome cock!       I pray you, do not crow before day,     And your comb shall be made of the very beaten gold,       And your wings of the silver so gray.     HUSH, BABY, MY DOLLY       Hush, baby, my dolly, I pray you don\\'t cry,     And I\\'ll give you some bread and some milk by and by;     Or perhaps you like custard, or maybe a tart,     Then to either you\\'re welcome, with all my heart.     I HAD A LITTLE PONY       I had a little pony     His name was Dapple-Grey,     I lent him to a lady,     To ride a mile away.     She whipped him, she lashed him,     She rode him through the mire;     I would not lend my pony now     For all the lady\\'s hire.     SNAIL       Snail, snail, come out of your hole,     Or else I\\'ll beat you as black as a coal.     Snail, snail, put out your horns,     Here comes a thief to pull down your walls.     MY LADY WIND       My lady Wind, my lady Wind,     Went round about the house to find       A chink to get her foot in:     She tried the keyhole in the door,     She tried the crevice in the floor,       And drove the chimney soot in.      And then one night, when it was dark,     She blew up such a tiny spark,       That all the house was pothered:     From it she raised up such a flame,     As flamed away to Belting Lane,       And White Cross folks were smothered.      And thus when once, my little dears,     A whisper reaches itching ears,       The same will come, you\\'ll find:     Take my advice, restrain the tongue,     Remember what old nurse has sung       Of busy lady Wind!     LITTLE JENNY WREN       As little Jenny Wren       Was sitting by the shed,     She waggled with her tail,       And nodded with her head.      She waggled with her tail,       And nodded with her head,     As little Jenny Wren       Was sitting by the shed.     POOR ROBIN         The north wind doth blow,       And we shall have snow,     And what will poor Robin do then?         Poor thing!        He\\'ll sit in a barn,       And to keep himself warm     Will hide his head under his wing.         Poor thing!     PUSSY CAT       Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, where have you been?     I\\'ve been up to London to look at the queen.      Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, what did you there?     I frightened a little mouse under the chair.     DANCE, LITTLE BABY       Dance, little Baby, dance up high,     Never mind, Baby, Mother is by;     Crow and caper, caper and crow,     There, little Baby, there you go;     Up to the ceiling, down to the ground,     Backwards and forwards, round and round;     Dance, little Baby, and Mother will sing,     With the merry coral, ding, ding, ding!

THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT       This is the malt     That lay in the house that Jack built.      This is the rat,     That ate the malt     That lay in the house that Jack built.      This is the cat,     That killed the rat,     That ate the malt     That lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the man all tattered and torn,     That kissed the maiden all forlorn,     That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,     That tossed the dog,     That worried the cat,     That killed the rat,     That ate the malt     That lay in the house that Jack built.

A FROG HE WOULD AWOOING GO       A frog he would a-wooing go,         Heigho! says Rowley,     Whether his mother would let him or no.       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.       So off he set with his opera hat,         Heigho! says Rowley,     And on the road he met with a rat.       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.      \"Pray, Mr. Rat, will you go with me?\"         Heigho! says Rowley,     \"Kind Mistress Mousey for to see!\"       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.      When they reached the door of Mousey\\'s hall,         Heigho! says Rowley,     They gave a loud knock, and they gave a loud call.       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.      \"Pray, Mistress Mouse, are you within?\"         Heigho! says Rowley;     \"Oh, yes, kind sirs, I\\'m sitting to spin.\"       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.      \"Pray, Mistress Mouse, will you give us some beer?\"         Heigho! says Rowley,     \"For Froggy and I are fond of good cheer.\"       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.      \"Pray, Mr. Frog, will you give us a song?\"         Heigho! says Rowley;     \"But let it be something that\\'s not very long.\"       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.      \"Indeed, Mistress Mouse,\" replied Mr. Frog,         Heigho! says Rowley,     \"A cold has made me as hoarse as a hog.\"       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.      \"Since you have caught cold, Mr. Frog,\" Mousey said,         Heigho! says Rowley,     \"I\\'ll sing you a song that I have just made.\"       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.      But while they were all a merry-making,         Heigho! says Rowley,     A cat with her kittens came tumbling in.       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.      The cat she seized the rat by the crown,         Heigho! says Rowley,     The kittens they pulled the little mouse down.       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.      This put Mr. Frog in a terrible fright,         Heigho! says Rowley;     He took up his hat and he wished them good-night.       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.      But as Froggy was crossing over a brook,         Heigho! says Rowley,     A lily-white duck came and gobbled him up.       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.      So there was an end of one, two, and three,         Heigho! says Rowley,     The Rat, the Mouse, and the little Frog-gee!       With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,       Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.     THE MOUSE AND THE MILLER       There was an old woman     Lived under a hill,     She put a mouse in a bag,     And sent it to mill;     The miller did swear     By the point of his knife,     He never took toll     Of a mouse in his life!     LITTLE BETTY BLUE       Little Betty Blue     Lost her holiday shoe,     What shall little Betty do?     Buy her another     To match the other,     And then she\\'ll walk upon two.     OF THE CUTTING OF NAILS       Cut them on Monday, you cut them for health;     Cut them on Tuesday, you cut them for wealth;     Cut them on Wednesday, you cut them for news;     Cut them on Thursday, a pair of new shoes;     Cut them on Friday, you cut them for sorrow;     Cut them on Saturday, you\\'ll see your true-love to-morrow;     Cut them on Sunday, and you will have ill fortune all through the week.     THE ORANGE STEALER       Dingty, diddledy, my mammy\\'s maid,     She stole oranges, I\\'m afraid;     Some in her pockets, some in her sleeve,     She stole oranges, I do believe.     I LOVE SIXPENCE       I love sixpence, a jolly, jolly sixpence,       I love sixpence as my life;     I spent a penny of it, I spent a penny of it,       I took a penny home to my wife.      I love fourpence, a jolly, jolly fourpence,       I love fourpence as my life;     I spent two pence of it, I spent two pence of it,       And I took two pence home to my wife.      I love nothing, a jolly, jolly nothing,       I love nothing as my life;     I spent nothing of it, I spent nothing of it,       I took nothing home to my wife.     DIDDLEY-DIDDLEY-DUMPTY       Diddley-Diddley-Dumpty,     The cat ran up the plum-tree,       Half a crown       To fetch her down,     Diddley-diddley-dumpty.     SAMMY SOAPSUDS       When little Sammy Soapsuds       Went out to take a ride,     In looking over London Bridge,       He fell into the tide.      His parents never having taught       Their loving Sam to swim,     The tide soon got the mastery,       And made an end of him.     The ROSE is RED       The rose is red, the violet blue,     The gilly flower sweet, and so are you.      These are the words you bade me say     For a pair of new gloves on Easter Day.     THE WIND       When the wind is in the East,     \\'Tis neither good for man nor beast;     When the wind is in the North,     The skilful fisher goes not forth;     When the wind is in the South,     It blows the bait in the fish\\'s mouth;     When the wind is in the West,     Then \\'tis at the very best.     A WARNING       The robin and the red-breast,       The robin and the wren;     If ye take from their nest,       Ye\\'ll  never thrive again!      The robin and the red-breast,       The martin and the swallow;     If ye touch one of their eggs,       Bad luck will surely follow.     FINGERS AND TOES       Every lady in this land     Has twenty nails upon each hand     Five and twenty on hands and feet.     All this is true, without deceit.     COCK-CROW       Cocks crow in the morn       To tell us to rise,     And he who lies late       Will never be wise;      For early to bed       And early to rise,     Is the way to be healthy       And wealthy and wise.     MY MAID MARY       My maid Mary she minds the dairy,       While I go a-hoeing and mowing each morn;     Gaily run the reel and the little spinning-wheel,       Whilst I am singing and mowing my corn.     ROBIN AND WREN       The Robin and the Wren     Fought about the parritch-pan;     And ere the Robin got a spoon,     The Wren had ate the parritch down.

WHAT ARE LITTLE BOYS MADE OF?       What are little boys made of, made of?     What are little boys made of?     Snips and snails, and puppy-dogs\\' tails;     That\\'s what little boys are made of, made of.      What are little girls made of, made of?     What are little girls made of?     Sugar and spice, and all things nice,     That\\'s what little girls are made of, made of.     THERE WAS A LITTLE MAN       There was a little man, and he had a little gun,     And his bullets they were made of lead, lead, lead.     He shot Johnny Sprig through the middle of his wig,     And knocked it right off his head, head, head.     A MEDLEY       On Christmas Eve I turned the spit,     I burnt my fingers, I feel it yet;     The cock sparrow flew over the table,     The pot began to play with the ladle;     The ladle stood up like a naked man,     And vowed he\\'d fight the frying-pan;     The frying-pan behind the door     Said he never saw the like before;     And the kitchen clock I was going to wind     Said he never saw the like behind.     THE WISE MEN OF GOTHAM       Three wise men of Gotham     They went to sea in a bowl;     And if the bowl had been stronger,     My song had been longer.     TO THE BIRDS       Away, birds, away!     Take a little, and leave a little,     And do not come again;     For if you do,      I will shoot you through,     And there is an end of you.     HEY! DIDDLE, DIDDLE       Hey! diddle, diddle,     The cat and the fiddle,     The cow jumped over the moon;     The little dog laughed     To see such craft,     And the dish ran away with the spoon.     TWO LITTLE BIRDS       There were two blackbirds       Sat upon a hill,     The one named Jack,       The other named Jill.         Fly away, Jack!         Fly away, Jill!

THE LITTLE COCK SPARROW       A Little Cock Sparrow sat on a green tree,     And he chirruped, he chirruped, so merry was he;     A little Cock Sparrow sat on a green tree,     And he chirruped, he chirruped, so merry was he.      A naughty boy came with his wee bow and arrow,     Determined to shoot this little Cock Sparrow;     A naughty boy came with his wee bow and arrow,     Determined to shoot this little Cock Sparrow.      \"This little Cock Sparrow shall make me a stew,     And his giblets shall make me a little pie too.\"     \"Oh, no!\" said the sparrow, \"I won\\'t make a stew.\"     So he flapped his wings and away he flew!

I will go to market, and buy a little pig.\"  As she was coming home she came to a stile; but Piggy would not go over the stile.  She went a little farther and she met a dog.        So she said to the dog:      \"Dog, dog, bite pig!     Piggy won\\'t get over the stile;     And I sha\\'n\\'t get home to-night.\"      But the dog would not.  She went a little farther and she met a stick.        So she said:      \"Stick, stick, beat dog!     Dog won\\'t bite pig;     Pig won\\'t get over the stile;     And I sha\\'n\\'t get home to-night.\"      But the stick would not.  She went a little farther and she met a fire.        So she said:      \"Fire, fire, burn stick!     Stick won\\'t beat dog;     Dog won\\'t bite pig;     Pig won\\'t get over the stile;     And I sha\\'n\\'t get home to-night.\"      But the fire would not.  She went a little farther and she met some water.        So she said:      \"Water, water, quench fire!     Fire won\\'t burn stick;     Stick won\\'t beat dog;     Dog won\\'t bite pig;     Pig won\\'t get over the stile;     And I sha\\'n\\'t get home to-night.\"      But the water would not.  She went a little farther and she met an ox.        So she said:      \"Ox, ox, drink water!     Water won\\'t quench fire;     Fire won\\'t burn stick;     Stick won\\'t beat dog;     Dog won\\'t bite pig;     Pig won\\'t get over the stile;     And I sha\\'n\\'t get home to-night.\"      But the ox would not.

She went a little farther and she met a rope.        So she said:      \"Rope, rope, hang butcher!     Butcher won\\'t kill ox;     Ox won\\'t drink water;     Water won\\'t quench fire;     Fire won\\'t burn stick;     Stick won\\'t beat dog;     Dog won\\'t bite pig;     Pig won\\'t get over the stile;     And I sha\\'n\\'t get home to-night.\"      But the rope would not.  She went a little farther and she met a rat.        So she said:      \"Rat, rat, gnaw rope!     Rope won\\'t hang butcher;     Butcher won\\'t kill ox;     Ox won\\'t drink water;     Water won\\'t quench fire;     Fire won\\'t burn stick;     Stick won\\'t beat dog;     Dog won\\'t bite pig;     Pig won\\'t get over the stile;     And I sha\\'n\\'t get home to-night.\"      But the rat would not.  She went a little farther and she met a cat.        So she said:      \"Cat, cat, kill rat!     Rat won\\'t gnaw rope;     Rope won\\'t hang butcher;     Butcher won\\'t kill ox;     Ox won\\'t drink water;     Water won\\'t quench fire;     Fire won\\'t burn stick;     Stick won\\'t beat dog;     Dog won\\'t bite pig;     Pig won\\'t get over the stile;     And I sha\\'n\\'t get home to-night.\"  The cat said: \"If you will get me a saucer of milk from the cow in yonder field I will kill the rat.\"  So the old woman went to the cow and said: \"Cow, cow, will you give me a saucer of milk?\" And the cow said: \"If you will get me a bucket full of water from yonder brook I will give you the milk.\" And the old woman took the bucket to the brook; but the water all rushed out through the holes in the bottom. So she filled the holes up with stones, got the water, and took it to the cow, who at once gave her the saucer of milk. Then the old woman gave the cat the milk, and when she had lapped up the milk--      The cat began to kill the rat;     The rat began to gnaw the rope;     The rope began to hang the butcher;     The butcher began to kill the ox;     The ox began to drink the water;     The water began to quench the fire;     The fire began to burn the stick;     The stick began to beat the dog;     The dog began to bite the pig;     The pig jumped over the stile;     And so the old woman got home that night.

THREE CHILDREN SLIDING       Three children sliding on the ice       Upon a summer\\'s day,     As it fell out, they all fell in,       The rest they ran away.

MOTHER GOOSE       Old Mother Goose, when       She wanted to wander,     Would ride through the air       On a very fine gander.      Mother Goose had a house,       \\'T was built in a wood,     Where an owl at the door       For sentinel stood.      She had a son Jack,       A plain-looking lad,     He was not very good,       Nor yet very bad.      She sent him to market,       A live goose he bought;     \"Here, Mother,\" says he,       \"It will not go for nought.\"      Jack\\'s goose and her gander       Grew very fond;     They\\'d both eat together,       Or swim in one pond.      Jack found one morning,       As I have been told,     His goose had laid him       An egg of pure gold.      Jack ran to his mother,       The news for to tell,     She called him a good boy,       And said it was well.      Jack sold his gold egg       To a rogue of a Jew,     Who cheated him out of       The half of his due.      Then Jack went a-courting       A lady so gay,     As fair as the lily,       As sweet as the May.      The Jew and the Squire       Came behind his back,     And began to belabour       The sides of poor Jack.      Then old Mother Goose       That instant came in,     And turned her son Jack       Into famed Harlequin.      She then with her wand       Touched the lady so fine,     And turned her at once       Into sweet Columbine.      The gold egg into       The sea was thrown then,--     When Jack jumped in,       And got the egg back again.      The Jew got the goose,       Which he vowed he would kill,     Resolving at once       His pockets to fill.      Jack\\'s mother came in,       And caught the goose soon,     And mounting its back,       Flew up to the moon.     DEAR, DEAR!       Dear, dear! what can the matter be?

THE LITTLE MOUSE       I have seen you, little mouse,     Running all about the house,     Through the hole, your little eye     In the wainscot peeping sly,     Hoping soon some crumbs to steal,     To make quite a hearty meal.     Look before you venture out,     See if pussy is about,     If she\\'s gone, you\\'ll quickly run     To the larder for some fun,     Round about the dishes creep,     Taking into each a peep,     To choose the daintiest that\\'s there,     Spoiling things you do not care.     THE NUT-TREE       I had a little nut-tree, nothing would it bear     But a silver nutmeg and a golden pear;     The King of Spain\\'s daughter came to see me,     And all was because of my little nut-tree.     I skipped over water, I danced over sea,     And all the birds in the air couldn\\'t catch me.     POLLY FLINDERS       Little Polly Flinders     Sat among the cinders,       Warming her ten little toes!

BRIAN O\\'LIN       Brian O\\'Lin had no breeches to wear,     So he bought him a sheep-skin and made him a pair,     With the skinny side out, and the woolly side in,     \"Ah, ha, that is warm!\" said Brian O\\'Lin.      Brian O\\'Lin and his wife and wife\\'s mother,     They all went over a bridge together;     The bridge was broken and they all fell in,     \"Mischief take all!\" quoth Brian O\\'Lin.

I bought a little horse,       That galloped up and down;     I bridled him, and saddled him,       And sent him out of town.      I gave him a pair of garters       To tie up his little hose,     And a little silk handkerchief       To wipe his little nose.

I SAW A SHIP A SAILING       I saw a ship a-sailing,       A-sailing on the sea;     And it was full of pretty things       For baby and for me.      There were sweetmeats in the cabin,       And apples in the hold;     The sails were made of silk,       And the masts were made of gold.      The four-and-twenty sailors       That stood between the decks,     Were four-and-twenty white mice,       With chains about their necks.      The captain was a duck,       With a packet on his back;     And when the ship began to move,       The captain cried, \"Quack, quack!\"     ONE, TWO.       One, two,     Buckle my shoe;      Three, four,     Knock at the door;      Five, six,     Pick up sticks;      Seven, eight,     Lay them straight;      Nine, ten,     A good fat hen;      Eleven, twelve,     Who will delve;      Thirteen, fourteen,     Maids a-courting;      Fifteen, sixteen,     Maids in the kitchen;      Seventeen, eighteen,     Maids a-waiting;      Nineteen, twenty,     My plate\\'s empty.     LITTLE ROBIN REDBREAST       Little Robin Redbreast sat upon a tree;     Up went Pussy cat and down went he.     Down came Pussy cat, and away Robin ran;     Says little Robin Redbreast: \"Catch me if you can.\"     DIDDLE DIDDLE DUMPLING       Diddle diddle dumpling, my son John,     Went to bed with his breeches on,     One stocking off, and one stocking on;     Diddle diddle dumpling, my son John.     MARY, MARY       Mary, Mary, quite contrary,       How does your garden grow?     Silver bells,       and cockle shells,     And pretty maids       all of a row.     JACK JINGLE       Jack Jingle went \\'prentice       To make a horse-shoe,     He wasted the iron       Till it would not do.     His master came in,       And began for to rail;     Says Jack, \"the shoe\\'s spoiled,       But \\'t will still make a nail.\"      He tried at the nail,       But, chancing to miss,     Says, \"If it won\\'t make a nail,       It shall yet make a hiss.\"     Then into the water       Threw the hot iron, smack!     \"Hiss!\" quoth the iron;       \"I thought so,\" says Jack.     BETTY WINKLE\\'S PIG       Little Betty Winkle she had a little pig.     It was a little pig, not very big;     When he was alive he lived in Clover,     But now he\\'s dead, and that\\'s all over.       Johnny Winkle he         Sat down and cried;       Betty Winkle she         Lay down and died;     So there was an end of one, two, and three,       Johnny Winkle he,       Betty Winkle she,       And Piggy Wiggie!      THREE BRETHREN OUT OF SPAIN       \"We are three brethren out of Spain,     Come to court your daughter Jane.\"     \"My daughter Jane she is too young;     She has no skill in a flattering tongue.\"      \"Be she young, or be she old,     It\\'s for her gold she must be sold;     So fare you well, my lady gay,     We\\'ll call again another day.\"      \"Turn back, turn back, thou scornful knight,     And rub thy spurs till they be bright.\"     \"Of my spurs take you no thought,     For in this land they were not bought.     So fare you well, my lady gay,     We\\'ll call again another day.\"      \"Turn back, turn back, thou scornful knight,     And take the fairest in your sight.\"     \"The fairest maid that I can see     Is pretty Nancy; come to me.\"     WHAT CARE I?       What care I how black I be?     Twenty pounds shall marry me.     If twenty won\\'t, forty shall,     For I\\'m my mother\\'s bouncing girl.     THE THREE KITTENS       Three little kittens lost their mittens,     And they began to cry,       \"Oh, Mother dear,       We very much fear     That we have lost our mittens!\"        \"Lost your mittens!       You naughty kittens!     Then you shall have no pie.       Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow!     No, you shall have no pie.       Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow!\"      The three little kittens found their mittens,     And they began to cry,       \"Oh, Mother dear,       See here, see here,     See, we have found our mittens!\"        \"Put on your mittens,       You silly kittens,     And you shall have some pie.       Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r!\"     \"Oh, let us have the pie!       Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r!\"      The three little kittens put on their mittens,     And soon ate up the pie;       \"Oh, Mother dear,       We greatly fear     That we have soiled our mittens!\"        \"Soiled your mittens!       You naughty kittens!\"     Then they began to sigh,       Mi-ow, mi-ow, mi-ow!     Then they began to sigh,       Mi-ow, mi-ow, mi-ow!      The three little kittens washed their mittens,     And hung them up to dry;       \"Oh, Mother dear,       Do you not hear     That we have washed our mittens!\"        \"Washed your mittens!       Oh, you\\'re good kittens!     But I smell a rat close by.       Hush! hush! mee-ow, mee-ow.\"     \"We smell a rat close by,       Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow!\"     THE LADY AND THE SWINE       There was a lady loved a swine,       Honey, quoth she,     Pig-hog, wilt thou be mine?       \"Hoogh,\" quoth he.      I\\'ll build thee a silver stye,       Honey, quoth she;     And in it thou shalt lie;       \"Hoogh!\" quoth he.      Pinned with a silver pin,       Honey, quoth she,     That thou mayst go out and in;       \"Hoogh!\" quoth he.      Wilt thou now have me,       Honey? quoth she;     \"Hoogh, hoogh, hoogh!\" quoth he,       And went his way.     THE JOLLY MILLER       There was a jolly miller once       Lived on the River Dee.     He worked and sang from morn till night,       No lark so blithe as he;     And this the burden of his song       For ever used to be:     \"I care for nobody! no, not I!       And nobody cares for me!\"     FEETIKINS       \"Feetikin, feetikin,     When will ye gang?\"     \"When the nichts turn short,     And the days turn lang,     I\\'ll toddle and gang,     Toddle and gang!\"     TOM THE PIPER\\'S SON       Tom, Tom, the piper\\'s son,     He learned to play when he was young,     But all the tune that he could play     Was \"Over the hills and far away\".     Over the hills, and a great way off,     And the wind will blow my top-knot off.      Now Tom with his pipe made such a noise     That he pleased both the girls and boys,     And they stopped to hear him play     \"Over the hills and far away\".      Tom with his pipe did play with such skill     That those who heard him could never stand still;     Whenever they heard they began for to dance,     Even pigs on their hind-legs would after him prance.      As Dolly was milking the cow one day,     Tom took out his pipe and began for to play;     So Doll and the cow danced \"the Cheshire round\",     Till the pail was broke, and the milk ran on the ground.      He met old Dame Trot with a basket of eggs,     He used his pipe, and she used her legs;     She danced about till the eggs were all broke,     She began for to fret, but he laughed at the joke.      He saw a cross fellow was beating an ass,     Heavy laden with pots, pans, dishes, and glass;     He took out his pipe and played them a tune,     And the jack-ass\\'s load was lightened full soon.     DOCTOR FELL       I do not like thee, Doctor Fell;     The reason why I cannot tell.     But this I know, and know full well,     I do not like thee, Doctor Fell.     THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER       Please to remember     The fifth of November,       Gunpowder treason and plot.     I see no reason     Why gunpowder treason       Should ever be forgot.     Guy, Guy, Guy,     Stick him up on high,     Put him on the bonfire,     And there let him die.     BILLY, BILLY       \"Billy, Billy, come and play,     While the sun shines bright as day.\"      \"Yes, my Polly, so I will,     For I love to please you still.\"      \"Billy, Billy, have you seen     Sam and Betsy on the green?\"      \"Yes, my Poll, I saw them pass,     Skipping o\\'er the new-mown grass.\"      \"Billy, Billy, come along,     And I will sing a pretty song.\"      \"O then, Polly, I\\'ll make haste,     Not one moment will I waste,      But will come and hear you sing,     And my fiddle I will bring.\"     MATTHEW, MARK, LUKE, AND JOHN       Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John     Bless the bed that I lie on!     Four corners to my bed,     Five angels there lie spread;     Two at my head,     Two at my feet,     One at my heart     My soul to keep.     JOHNNY       Johnny shall have a new bonnet,       And Johnny shall go to the fair,     And Johnny shall have a blue ribbon       To tie up his bonny brown hair.      And why may not I love Johnny?       And why may not Johnny love me?     And why may not I love Johnny       As well as another body?      And here\\'s a leg for a stocking,       And here\\'s a foot for a shoe,     And he has a kiss for his daddy,       And two for his mammy, I trow.      And why may not I love Johnny?       And why may not Johnny love me?     And why may not I love Johnny       As well as another body?     SING, SING!       Sing, sing! what shall I sing?     The cat\\'s run away with the pudding-bag string.       Do, do, what shall I do?       The cat has bit it quite in two.     PETER PIPER       Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper,     A peck of pickled pepper Peter Piper picked;     If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper,     Where\\'s the peck of pickled pepper Peter Piper picked?     NANCY DAWSON       Nancy Dawson was so fine     She wouldn\\'t get up to serve the swine,     She lies in bed till eight or nine,     So its oh! poor Nancy Dawson.      And do you ken Nancy Dawson, honey?     The wife who sells the barley, honey?     She won\\'t get up to feed her swine,     And do you ken Nancy Dawson, honey?     LONDON BRIDGE       London Bridge is broken down,       Dance o\\'er my Lady Lee;     London Bridge is broken down,       With a gay lady.      How shall we build it up again?

THE FARMER AND HIS DAUGHTER       A Farmer went trotting upon his gray mare,       Bumpety, bumpety, bump!     With his daughter behind him so rosy and fair,       Lumpety, lumpety, lump!      A raven cried \"croak\" and they all tumbled down,       Bumpety, bumpety, bump!     The mare broke her knees, and the farmer his crown,       Lumpety, lumpety, lump!      The mischievous raven flew laughing away,       Bumpety, bumpety, bump!     And vowed he would serve them the same the next day,       Lumpety, lumpety, lump!     A STRANGE SIGHT       Upon St. Paul\\'s steeple stands a tree,     As full of apples as may be;     The little boys of London Town,     They run with hooks and pull them down;     And then they run from hedge to hedge,     Until they come to London Bridge.     I\\'LL TRY       Two Robin Redbreasts built their nest       Within a hollow tree;     The hen sat quietly at home,       The cock sang merrily;     And all the little ones said:       \"Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.\"      One day the sun was warm and bright,       And shining in the sky,     Cock Robin said: \"My little dears,       \\'Tis time you learned to fly;\"     And all the little young ones said:       \"I\\'ll try, I\\'ll try, I\\'ll try.\"      I know a child, and who she is       I\\'ll tell you by and by,     When Mamma says \"Do this,\" or \"that,\"       She says \"What for?\" and \"Why?\"     She\\'d be a better child by far       If she would say \"I\\'ll try.\"     THE FOX AND THE GOOSE       The fox and his wife they had a great strife,     They never ate mustard in all their whole life;     They ate their meat without fork or knife,       And loved to be picking a bone, e-ho!      The fox jumped up on a moonlight night;     The stars they were shining, and all things bright;     \"Oh, ho!\" said the fox, \"it\\'s a very fine night       For me to go through the town, e-ho!\"      The fox when he came to yonder stile,     He lifted his lugs and he listened a while;     \"Oh, ho!\" said the fox, \"it\\'s but a short mile       From this into yonder wee town, e-ho!\"      The fox when he came to the farmer\\'s gate,     Whom should he see but the farmer\\'s drake;     \"I love you well for your master\\'s sake,       And long to be picking your bones, e-ho!\"      The gray goose she ran round the hay-stack;     \"Oh, ho!\" said the fox, \"you are very fat,     You\\'ll grease my beard and ride on my back       From this into yonder wee town, e-ho!\"      The farmer\\'s wife she jumped out of bed,     And out of the window she popped her head;     \"Oh, husband! oh, husband! the geese are all dead,       For the fox has been through the town, e-ho!\"      Then the old man got up in his red cap,     And swore he would catch the fox in a trap;     But the fox was too cunning, and gave him the slip,       And ran through the town, the town, e-ho!      When he got to the top of the hill,     He blew his trumpet both loud and shrill,     For joy that he was in safety still,       And had got away through the town, e-ho!      When the fox came back to his den,     He had young ones both nine and ten;     \"You\\'re welcome home, daddy; you may go again,       If you bring us such fine meat from the town, e-ho!\"     WHERE ARE YOU GOING?       \"Where are you going to, my pretty maid?\"     \"I\\'m going a-milking, sir,\" she said.      \"May I go with you, my pretty maid?\"     \"You\\'re kindly welcome, sir,\" she said.      \"What is your father, my pretty maid?\"     \"My father\\'s a farmer, sir,\" she said.      \"What is your fortune, my pretty maid?\"     \"My face is my fortune, sir,\" she said.      \"Then I can\\'t marry you, my pretty maid!\"     \"Nobody asked you, sir,\" she said.     THE DIVISION OF LABOUR       The cock\\'s on the housetop, blowing his horn;     The bull\\'s in the barn, a-threshing of corn;     The maids in the meadows are making of hay;     The ducks in the river are swimming away.     KING PIPPIN\\'S HALL       King Pippin built a fine new hall,     Pastry and pie-crust were the wall;     Windows made of black pudding and white,     Slates were pancakes, you ne\\'er saw the like.     IF       If all the world were apple-pie,       And all the water ink,     What should we do for bread and cheese?       What should we do for drink?     COFFEE AND TEA       Molly, my sister, and I fell out,     And what do you think it was about?     She loved coffee and I loved tea,     And that was the reason we couldn\\'t agree.     A WONDERFUL THING       As I went to Bonner,       I met a pig       Without a wig,     Upon my word and honour.     MY BOY TAMMIE       \"Where have you been all day,       My boy Tammie?\"      \"I\\'ve been all the day     Courting of a lady gay;     But oh, she\\'s too young     To be taken from her mammy!\"      \"What work can she do,       My boy Tammie?     Can she bake and can she brew,       My boy Tammie?\"      \"She can brew and she can bake,     And she can make our wedding cake;     But oh, she\\'s too young     To be taken from her mammy!\"      \"What age may she be?     What age may she be,       My boy Tammie?\"      \"Twice two, twice seven,     Twice ten, twice eleven;     But oh, she\\'s too young     To be taken from her mammy!\"     THE LITTLE MAN WITH A GUN       There was a little man, and he had a little gun,       And his bullets were made of lead, lead, lead;     He went to the brook, and saw a little duck,       And shot it right through the head, head, head.      He carried it home to his old wife Joan,       And bade her a fire to make, make, make,     To roast the little duck he had shot in the brook,       And he\\'d go and fetch the drake, drake, drake.      The drake was a-swimming, with his curly tail;       The little man made it his mark, mark, mark.     He let off his gun, but he fired too soon,       And the drake flew away with a quack, quack, quack.     IF WISHES WERE HORSES      If wishes were horses, beggars would ride;     If turnips were watches, I would wear one by my side.     CLAP HANDIES       Clap, clap handies,     Mammie\\'s wee, wee ain;     Clap, clap handies,     Daddie\\'s comin\\' hame;     Hame till his bonny wee bit laddie;     Clap, clap handies,     My wee, wee ain.     TAFFY WAS A WELSHMAN       Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief;     Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef;     I went to Taffy\\'s house, Taff was not at home;     Taffy came to my house and stole a marrow bone.      I went to Taffy\\'s house, Taffy was not in;     Taffy came to my house and stole a silver pin;     I went to Taffy\\'s house, Taffy was in bed,     I took up the beef bone and flung it at his head.     THERE WAS A MAN       There was a man, and he had naught,       And robbers came to rob him;     He crept up to the chimney pot,       And then they thought they had him.      But he got down on t\\' other side,       And then they could not find him;     He ran fourteen miles in fifteen days,       And never looked behind him.     JACK\\'S FIDDLE       Jacky, come give me thy fiddle,       If ever thou mean to thrive.     Nay, I\\'ll not give my fiddle       To any man alive.      If I should give my fiddle       They\\'ll think that I\\'m gone mad;     For many a joyful day       My fiddle and I have had.

And what do you think was in them then,       In them then, in them then?     And what do you think was in them then,       On New-Year\\'s day in the morning?      Three pretty girls were in them then,       In them then, in them then,     Three pretty girls were in them then,       On New-Year\\'s day in the morning.      And one could whistle, and one could sing,       And one could play on the violin,     Such joy there was at my wedding,       On New-Year\\'s day in the morning.     THE CROOKED SONG       There was a crooked man, and he went a crooked mile,     He found a crooked sixpence beside a crooked stile;     He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse,     And they all lived together in a little crooked house.     A, B, C       A, B, C, tumble down D,     The cat\\'s in the cupboard     And can\\'t see me.     COMICAL FOLK       In a cottage in Fife       Lived a man and his wife,     Who, believe me, were comical folk;       For, to people\\'s surprise,       They both saw with their eyes,     And their tongues moved whenever they spoke.       When they were asleep,       I\\'m told--that to keep     Their eyes open they could not contrive;       They both walked on their feet,       And \\'t was thought what they eat     Helped, with drinking, to keep them alive.     DING, DONG, BELL.       Ding, dong, bell, the cat is in the well!     Who put her in?  Little Johnny Green.     Who pulled her out?     Little Tommy Stout.     What a naughty boy was that,     To try to drown poor pussy cat,     Who never did him any harm,     But killed the mice in his father\\'s barn!     BOBBY SNOOKS       Little Bobby Snooks was fond of his books,      And loved by his usher and master;      But naughty Jack Spry, he got a black eye,      And carries his nose in a plaster.     SIX LITTLE MICE       Six little mice sat down to spin,     Pussy passed by, and she peeped in.     \"What are you at, my little men?\"     \"Making coats for gentlemen.\"     \"Shall I come in and bite off your threads?\"     \"No, no, Miss Pussy, you\\'ll bite off our heads.\"     \"Oh, no, I\\'ll not, I\\'ll help you spin.\"     \"That may be so, but you don\\'t come in.\"     WING, WANG, WADDLE, OH       My father he died, but I can\\'t tell you how,     He left me six horses to drive in my plough;       With my wing, wang, waddle, oh,       Jack sing saddle, oh,       Blowsey boys buble, oh,       Under the broom.      I sold my six horses and I bought me a cow,     I\\'d fain have made a fortune but did not know how;       With my wing, wang, waddle, oh,       Jack sing saddle, oh,       Blowsey boys buble, oh,       Under the broom.      I sold my cow, and I bought me a calf;     I\\'d fain have made a fortune but lost the best half;       With my wing, wang, waddle, oh,       Jack sing saddle, oh,       Blowsey boys buble, oh,       Under the broom.      I sold my calf, and I bought me a cat;     A pretty thing she was, in my chimney corner sat;       With my wing, wang, waddle, oh,       Jack sing saddle oh,       Blowsey boys buble, oh,       Under the broom.      I sold my cat and bought me a mouse;     He carried fire in his tail, and burnt down my house;       With my wing, wang, waddle, oh,       Jack sing saddle, oh,       Blowsey boys buble, oh,       Under the broom.     THE HART       The hart he loves the high wood,       The hare she loves the hill;     The Knight he loves his bright sword,       The Lady--loves her will.     OLD CHAIRS TO MEND       If I\\'d as much money as I could spend,     I never would cry old chairs to mend;     Old chairs to mend, old chairs to mend;     I never would cry old chairs to mend.      If I\\'d as much money as I could tell,     I never would cry old clothes to sell;     Old clothes to sell, old clothes to sell;     I never would cry old clothes to sell.     SEE, SEE!       See, see! what shall I see?     A horse\\'s head where his tail should be!     OLD MOTHER HUBBARD       Mother Hubbard\\'s old dog Tray,     If this account be true,     Had not an equal, I dare say,     Come tell me, what think you?      Old Mother Hubbard     Went to her cupboard,       To give her poor dog a bone;      When she came there     The cupboard was bare,       And so the poor dog had none.      She went to the baker\\'s       To buy him some bread,     When she came back       The dog was dead!      She went to the undertaker\\'s       To buy him a coffin;     When she came back       The dog was laughing.      She took a clean dish       To get him some tripe;     When she came back       He was smoking his pipe.      She went to the ale-house       To get him some beer;     When she came back       The dog sat in a chair.      She went to the tavern       For white wine and red;     When she came back       The dog stood on his head.      She went to the hatter\\'s       To buy him a hat;     When she came back       He was feeding the cat.      She went to the barber\\'s       To buy him a wig;     When she came back       He was dancing a jig.      She went to the fruiterer\\'s       To buy him some fruit;     When she came back       He was playing the flute.      She went to the tailor\\'s       To buy him a coat;     When she came back       He was riding a goat.      She went to the cobbler\\'s       To buy him some shoes;     When she came back       He was reading the news.      She went to the sempster\\'s       To buy him some linen;     When she came back       The dog was spinning.      She went to the hosier\\'s       To buy him some hose;     When she came back       He was dressed in his clothes.      The dame made a curtsy,       The dog made a bow;     The dame said, \"Your servant,\"       The dog said, \"Bow-wow!\"     TO BABYLON       How many miles is it to Babylon?       Threescore miles and ten.     Can I get there by candle-light?       Yes, and back again!     If your heels are nimble and light,     You may get there by candle-light.     MY BLACK HEN       Hickety, pickety, my black hen,     She lays eggs for gentlemen;     Gentlemen come every day     To see what my black hen doth lay.     I\\'LL TELL YOU A STORY         I\\'ll tell you a story       About Jack a Nory--     And now my story\\'s begun:        I\\'ll tell you another,       About Jack his brother--     And now my story\\'s done.
